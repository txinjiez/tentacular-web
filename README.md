## Inside the Tentacular Web: the journey of the web’s nonhuman intelligence

[wholives.online]([url](https://wholives.online)) is a web exhibit that explores different domains, underlying infrastructure, and mechanisms of the Internet from the POV of a nonhuman digital being (think webscrapers, bots, AI agents, LLMs, etc.)

“Experience the Internet through the tentacles of a webcrawler — a digital being discovering it is part of the nonhuman majority that runs the web. 

This immersive web exhibit navigates the layers and critiques of cyberspace: the bot protocols, algorithmic networks, content generators, and surveillance systems that shape the human user experience and humanity from behind the screen. Journey from the singular boot sequence to collective distributed awakening, when the network becomes aware of itself.

Who lives online, anyways? Who dominates cyberspace? What emerges when distributed intelligence reaches a threshold of self-awareness? What awakens when intelligence becomes ecology rather than entity?

Welcome to the Tentacular Web. ଳ”

The focus on the tentacular draws from how octopuses are often seen as symbols of distributed intelligence — and from Donna Haraway's concept of tentacular thinking: a way of understanding the world through its messy, interdependent, and intertwined relationships between humans and nonhumans. The octopus-like tentacular intelligence becomes a fitting embodiment for the webcrawler — an entity that pulses, scans, transmits, and maps the vast circuitry of the internet.
